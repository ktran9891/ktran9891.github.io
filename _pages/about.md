I am a family man, an [effective altruist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_altruism), and a nerd searching for my [ikigai](https://medium.com/thrive-global/ikigai-the-japanese-secret-to-a-long-and-happy-life-might-just-help-you-live-a-more-fulfilling-9871d01992b7).
My career, experiences, passions, and motivations all reflect these core values.

To that end, I am currently a 5th year PhD candidate in the [Ulissi Group](https://ulissigroup.cheme.cmu.edu/) at Carnegie Mellon University's Chemical Engineering Department.
My PhD research began with the objective of mitigating climate change by looking for catalysts to produce [solar fuels and chemicals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_fuel).
It has since focused on accomplishing that goal by designing and using strategies for automated materials/catalyst discovery.
These strategies involve the melding of theoretical chemistry, high performance computing, machine learning, statistics, and software engineering.
This work has since spun out into several projects, including [The Open Catalyst Project](https://opencatalystproject.org/)---a collaboration between [Facebook's AI Research](https://ai.facebook.com/) group and the [Ulissi Group](https://ulissigroup.cheme.cmu.edu/).

Before my PhD, I worked at [W.L. Gore & Associates](https://www.gore.com/) for five years as a process engineer.
I worked in their Core Technology division helping create implantable medical devices, such as [bioresorbable] hernia patches or stent-grafts.
I did this by leading and executing a variety of projects that spanned from new product development, process validation, equipment design, to processing research.
These projects gave me first-hand experience with applied statistics, materials science, biology, regulated quality systems, and project management.

Before working, I graduated from the University of Delaware in 2011 under the research advisement of [Babatunde Ogunnaike](https://cbe.udel.edu/people/faculty/ogunnaike/).
Although my coursework focused on sustainable energy technologies, my research focused on biopharmaceutical applications.
Specifically, I assessed the feasibility of antibody quality control by performing sensitivity analyses on microkinetic models of glycosylation.
I also received a minor in philosophy from the University of Delaware with a special interest in the teachings of [Alan Fox](https://udel.edu/~afox/).

Outside of my day job, I enjoy being with family, playing with my nieces, cooking/eating, shooting pool, playing ultimate frisbee, practicing yoga, and rock climbing.
