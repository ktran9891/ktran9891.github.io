As we increase our reliance on renewable energy sources such as wind and solar, which produce intermittent power, storage is needed to transfer power from times of peak generation to peak demand.

Retrieved from http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.09435ling to nation-sized grids is the conversion of renewable energy to other fuels, such as hydrogen or methane. To be widely adopted, this process requires cost-effective solutions to running electrochemical reactions. An open challenge is finding low-cost electrocatalysts to drive these reactions at high rates. Through the use of quantum mechanical simulations (density functional theory), new catalyst structures can be tested and evaluated. Unfortunately, the high computational cost of these simulations limits the number of structures that may be tested. The use of machine learning may provide a method to efficiently approximate these calculations, leading to new approaches in finding effective electrocatalysts. In this paper, we provide an introduction to the challenges in finding suitable electrocatalysts, how machine learning may be applied to the problem, and the use of the Open Catalyst Project OC20 dataset for model training.},

abstract = {Catalyst discovery and optimization is key to solving many societal and energy challenges including solar fuels synthesis, long-term energy storage, and renewable fertilizer production. Despite considerable effort by the catalysis community to apply machine learning models to the computational catalyst discovery process, it remains an open challenge to build models that can generalize across both elemental compositions of surfaces and adsorbate identity/configurations, perhaps because datasets have been smaller in catalysis than related fields. To address this we developed the OC20 dataset, consisting of 1,281,121 Density Functional Theory (DFT) relaxations (264,900,500 single point evaluations) across a wide swath of materials, surfaces, and adsorbates (nitrogen, carbon, and oxygen chemistries). We supplemented this dataset with randomly perturbed structures, short timescale molecular dynamics, and electronic structure analyses. The dataset comprises three central tasks indicative of day-to-day catalyst modeling and comes with pre-defined train/validation/test splits to facilitate direct comparisons with future model development efforts. We applied three state-of-the-art graph neural network models (SchNet, Dimenet, CGCNN) to each of these tasks as baseline demonstrations for the community to build on. In almost every task, no upper limit on model size was identified, suggesting that even larger models are likely to improve on initial results. The dataset and baseline models are both provided as open resources, as well as a public leader board to encourage community contributions to solve these important tasks.},

Current systems use extremely expensive iridium oxide catalysts. Identifying Ir-free or catalysts with reduced Ir-composition has been suggested as goals, but no systematic strategy to discover such catalysts has been reported. In this work, we performed high-throughput computational screening to investigate bimetalic oxide catalysts with space groups derived from those of IrO{\$}{\_}x{\$}, identified promising OER catalysts predicted to satisfy all the desired properties: Co-Ir, Fe-Ir and Mo-Ir bimetallic oxides. We find that for the given crystal structures explored, it is essential to include noble metals to maintain the acid-stability, although one-to-one mixing of noble and non-noble metal oxides could keep the materials survive under the acidic conditions. Based on the calculated results, we provide insights to efficiently perform future high-throughput screening to discover catalysts with desirable properties.

abstract = {Data science and informatics tools have been proliferating recently within the computational materials science and catalysis fields. This proliferation has spurned the creation of various frameworks for automated materials screening, discovery, and design. Underpinning these frameworks are surrogate models with uncertainty estimates on their predictions. These uncertainty estimates are instrumental for determining which materials to screen next, but the computational catalysis field does not yet have a standard procedure for judging the quality of such uncertainty estimates. Here we present a suite of figures and performance metrics derived from the machine learning community that can be used to judge the quality of such uncertainty estimates. This suite probes the accuracy, calibration, and sharpness of a model quantitatively. We then show a case study where we judge various methods for predicting density-functional-theory-calculated adsorption energies. Of the methods studied here, we find that the best performer is a model where a convolutional neural network is used to supply features to a Gaussian process regressor, which then makes predictions of adsorption energies along with corresponding uncertainty estimates.},

abstract = {Developing active and stable oxygen evolution catalysts is a key to enabling various future energy technologies and the state-of-the-art catalyst is Ir-containing oxide materials. Understanding oxygen chemistry on oxide materials is significantly more complicated than studying transition metal catalysts for two reasons: the most stable surface coverage under reaction conditions is extremely important but difficult to understand without many detailed calculations, and there are many possible active sites and configurations on O* or OH* covered surfaces. We have developed an automated and high-throughput approach to solve this problem and predict OER overpotentials for arbitrary oxide surfaces. We demonstrate this for a number of previously-unstudied IrO 2 and IrO 3 polymorphs and their facets. We discovered that low index surfaces of IrO 2 other than rutile (110) are more active than the most stable rutile (110), and we identified promising active sites of IrO 2 and IrO 3 that outperform rutile (110) by 0.2 V in theoretical overpotential. Based on findings from DFT calculations, we provide catalyst design strategies to improve catalytic activity of Ir based catalysts and 1 demonstrate a machine learning model capable of predicting surface coverages and site activity. This work highlights the importance of investigating unexplored chemical space to design promising catalysts.},

abstract = {To function as intended in vivo, a majority of biopharmaceuticals require specific glycan distributions. However, achieving a precise glycan distribution during manufacturing can be challenging because glycosylation is a non-template driven cellular process, with the potential for significant uncontrolled variability in glycan distributions. As important as the glycan distribution is to the end-use performance of biopharmaceuticals, to date, no strategy exists for controlling glycosylation on-line. However, before expending the significant amount of effort and expense required to develop and implement on-line control strategies to address the problem of glycosylation heterogeneity, it is imperative to assess first the extent to which the very complex process of glycosylation is controllable, thereby establishing what is theoretically achievable prior to any experimental attempts. In this work, we present a novel methodology for assessing the output controllability of glycosylation, a prototypical example of an extremely high-dimensional and very non-linear system. We first discuss a method for obtaining the process gain matrix for glycosylation that involves performing model simulations and data analysis systematically and judiciously according to a statistical design of experiments (DOE) scheme and then employing Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) to determine the elements of process gain matrix from the resulting simulation data. We then discuss how to use the resulting high-dimensional gain matrix to assess controllability. The utility of this method is demonstrated with a practical example where we assess the controllability of various classes of glycans and of specific glycoforms that are typically found in recombinant biologics produced with Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells. In addition to providing useful insight into the extent to which on-line glycosylation control is achievable in actual manufacturing processes, the results also have important implications for genetically engineering cell lines design for enhanced glycosylation controllability.},
